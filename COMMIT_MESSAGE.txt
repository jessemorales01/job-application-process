refactor: Remove Contact model and unify Assessments/Interactions into Activities tab

This commit removes the Contact model entirely and consolidates Assessments
and Interactions into a unified "Activities" tab, following TDD principles.

Backend Changes:
- Remove Contact model from crm/models.py
- Remove contact ForeignKey field from Interaction model
- Remove ContactViewSet from crm/views.py
- Remove ContactSerializer from crm/serializers.py
- Remove contact_name field from InteractionSerializer
- Remove Contact route from crm/urls.py
- Remove ContactAdmin from crm/admin.py
- Create migration 0013_remove_contact_model.py to:
  - Remove contact field from Interaction model
  - Delete Contact model and related database table

Frontend Changes:
- Create new Activities.vue component that unifies:
  - Assessments (with deadline, status, recruiter contact info)
  - Interactions (with interaction date, type, subject)
  - Filtering by Application
  - Combined sorting by date (most recent first)
  - Separate dialogs for adding Assessments and Interactions
- Create Activities.test.js with 14 comprehensive test cases covering:
  - Component rendering and data loading
  - Combining and filtering activities
  - Dialog operations (open, save, delete)
  - Helper methods (status colors, deadline formatting)
  - Sorting logic
- Remove Contacts tab from Layout.vue navigation
- Remove Contacts and Interactions routes from router/index.js
- Delete Contacts.vue view component
- Update Dashboard.vue to:
  - Remove Contacts and Interactions navigation items
  - Replace Contacts/Interactions stats with unified Activities stat
  - Fetch assessments and interactions to calculate total activities
- Update Interactions.vue to remove contact field and related code:
  - Remove contact select field from form
  - Remove contact_name from table headers
  - Remove loadContacts() method
  - Remove contacts data property

Testing:
- All 50 backend tests passing
- Frontend tests for Activities component included
- Migration tested and applied successfully

This change simplifies the data model by removing the redundant Contact
entity (contact information is now stored directly in Assessment model
as recruiter_contact_* fields) and improves UX by providing a single
unified view for all activity-related data.
